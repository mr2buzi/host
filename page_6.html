                        <p>
                           When discussing Agile frameworks, the most popular of these is <strong>Scrum,</strong> which is derived from the rugby term, it is <em>lightweight</em> and predominately used in software development
                           Scrum was first used by <em>Hirotaka Takeuchi</em> and <em>Ikujiro Nonaka</em> in their guide <strong>"The New New Product Development Game."</strong> This was aligned to a game of rugby where a scrum is formed where team members work closely together supporting each other.  
                           It was formalised by Jeff Sutherland, John Scumniotales, and Jeff McKenna in 1993.

                        <p>
                           It is often referred to a process framework associated to a clear set of practices and guidelines that are performed within the Scrum itself. 
                           The most common word associated with Scrum is <b>Empiricism</b> - working in a fact-based, experience-based, and evidence-based manner. 
                           Scrum implements an empirical process where progress is based on real observations.
